               <td>1-AI would have a low error rate compared to humans, if coded properly. They would have incredible precision, accuracy, and speed.<br>
               2-They won't be affected by hostile environments, thus able to complete dangerous tasks, explore in space, and endure problems that would injure or kill us.<br>
               3-This can even mean mining and digging fuels that would otherwise be hostile for humans.<br>
               4-Replace humans in repetitive, tedious tasks and in many laborious places of work.<br> 5-Predict what a user will type, ask, search, and do. They can easily act as assitants and cna recommend or direct various actions.<br>
               6-Can detect fraud in card-based systems, and possibly other systems in the future. 
               <br>
               7-They don't need to sleep, rest, take breaks, or get entertained, as they don't get bored or tired.<br>
               8-Robotic pets can interact with humans. Can help w/ depression and inactivity.
               <br>
               9-Robotic radiosurgery, and other types of surgery in the future, can achieve precision that humans can't.

             <tr>
               <td>cons</td>
               <td>1-Can cost a lot of money and time to build, rebuild, and repair. Robotic repair can occur to reduce time and humans needing to fix it, but that'll cost more money and resources.<br>
               2-It's questionable: is it ethically and morally correct to have androids, human-like robots, or recreate intelligence, a gift of nature that shouldn't be recreated? This is a discussion about AI that's popular in the days.<br>
               3-Storage is expansive, but access and retrieval may not lead to connections in memory as well as humans could.<br>
               4-They can learn and get better with tasks if coded to, but it's questionable as to if this can ever become as good as humans can do such.<br>
               5-They could never, or, at least, seemingly never with our technological perceptions, recieve creativity that humans have.<br>
               6-Robots, with them replacing jobs, can lead to severe unemployment, unless if humans can fix the unemployment with jobs AI can't do or severly change the government to communism.<br>
               7-As seen partially with smartphones and other technology already, humans can become too dependent on AI and lose their mental capacities.<br>
               8-This can prevent sympathizing with emotions for human contact, such as in being nurses. This can also reduce wisdom can understanding.
